**CompareApp**: Custom comparison application that allows auto-sorting of options based on criteria.

Ever tried to make a decision and ended up writing scores of entries in poorly-sized tables in Excel, sorting them by things that can be sorted (quantifyable things like price as opposed to subjective things like neighborhoods etc.) and then still eye-balling your decision? Well, then this is the app for you!


## Use-Case Example

For example, if trying to compare three apartment options to move to, you might make a list like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adinutzyc21/ideal-engine/master/example.png" width="100%">

Then, you'll have to decide which features are more important (low price? space? user ratings? distance to work? etc.) and pick an apartment. 

This app would allow you to give relative importance to each of these criteria as well as score each option on each of these criteria, and then sort the columns based on the overall scores, to make decisions easier for you!
